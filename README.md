# EVGA_FanControl
EVGA_FanControl is an `AutoHotkey` `v2` script that allows you to control the GPU fans with preset settings via the [`EVGA Precision X1`](https://www.evga.com/precisionx1/).

Take control of your fans, adjust the fan speeds to maximize your GPU cooling and improve performance or keep the noise quiet.

Specifically for `EVGA` graphics cards through the [`EVGA Precision X1`](https://www.evga.com/precisionx1/) software.

The script allows for easy `adjustments to fan speeds` and reduces noise completely.

It uses menus in `AHK` for better control over the script.

The script will not work with other manufacturers' cards like `ASUS, MSI, etc.`

## How to use it?

Download both files and run the [`example file`](https://github.com/bceenaeiklmr/EVGA_FanControl/blob/main/EVGA_FanControl_example.ahk) to show how to use (call) the script.

Press `Win + c` to show the menu.

## Precision software's limitations

Unfortunately, the main script has to be called with Administrator privileges due to the limitations of the EVGA Precision X1 software.

This is the reason I separated this project into two files.
